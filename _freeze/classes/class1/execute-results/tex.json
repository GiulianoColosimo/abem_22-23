[...] bioinformatics combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics [...] using computational and statistical techniques.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\nBioinformaticians deal with a variety of different type of data! **We are not bioinformaticians!!** We are evolutionary biologists!! We will focus on nucleotide sequence data.\n:::\n\n## Why Bioinformatics\n\n>- Back in the days, biologists could analyze their data on personal computers. [Sanger Sequecing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) produced anywhere between 50 and 1000 nucleotides at a time to be analysed on a regular computer.\n>- Since 1994 scientist have begun developing new technologies to parallelize DNA sequencing and produce high throughput data.\n>- As these technologies improve, biologists need to harness the tools to design meaningful experiments to produce data and analyse them.\n\n## \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Drop of sequencing cost for Genomes and Nucleotides.

These are free cross-platform software.\n\n-   Visit the **R** (https://cran.r-project.org) page and download the **R** version compatible to your OS. Install the software following the instructions.\n\n-   Visit the **RStudio** (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) page and download the **RStudio** Desktop version compatible with your OS.
