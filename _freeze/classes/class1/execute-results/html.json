We will focus on nucleotide sequence data.\n:::\n\n## Why Bioinformatics\n\n> -   Back in the days, biologists could analyze their data on personal computers. [Sanger Sequecing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) produced anywhere between 50 and 1000 nucleotides at a time to be analysed on a regular computer.\n> -   Since 1994 scientist have begun developing new technologies to parallelize DNA sequencing and produce high throughput data.\n> -   As these technologies improve, biologists need to harness the tools to design meaningful experiments to produce data and analyse them.\n\n## \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Drop of sequencing cost for Genomes and Nucleotides. Data from [https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data)](class1_files/figure-revealjs/seq_cost-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Setting up your computer\n\n## \n\nTo visualize and analyse data and to produce reports on all the activities of this course we will be using **R** and **RStudio**. These are free cross-platform software.\n\n-   Visit the **R** (https://cran.r-project.org) page and download the **R** version compatible to your OS. Install the software following the instructions.\n\n-   Visit the **RStudio** (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) page and download the **RStudio** Desktop version compatible with your OS. Install the software following the instructions.\n\n## \n\n**NOTE**: **RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) within which it should be easier to organize your **R** workflow. [Learning all the specifics of **R** and **RStudio** is beyond the scope of this course and it is a student's responsibility to learn the basics of these tools. That being said, you can always write me with your questions if something does not work on your computer and I will help troubleshooting potential issues.]{.underline}\n\n## \n\nOnce installed, open **RStudio**. If everything worked appropriately when you first open **RStudio**, you should see 4 different panes organized in the following way:\n\n-   *top left*: the editor where you edit scripts, documents and can run code directly in the console;\n-   *bottom left*: the **R** console, where the code is run. You can type code directly into the console OR you can send it to the console by running it from the editor;\n-   *top right*: your environment/history panes. This is where you can see variables you've created and a full history of functions / commands you have run;\n-   *bottom right*: by default contains several panes including: files/plots/packages/help/viewer. The files pane allows you to explore files on your computer like you would in windows explorer or finder on a mac. The plots tab is where you will see plots that you create.\n\n## \n\n![R-Studio screenshot. You can change many of the aspects parameters (colors, font, panes etc.etc...).](../images/class1/rstudio.png){fig-alt=\"R-Studio screenshot\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Packages\n\nThere are thousands of available libraries (aka, *packages*) that can be used to perform very specific analyses and produce publication-grade graphical output.\n",
