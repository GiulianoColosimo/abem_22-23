## Acknowledgement 

Inspiration to build this class and website using [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) comes from the class course developed by Dr. Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel available [here](https://sta210-s22.github.io/website/). The main structure of this website is inspired by her work, and the freely available code has been tweaked, rearranged, and posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/GiulianoColosimo/abem_22-23).
