It is necessary that each student has his/her own laptop in order to better follow the various demonstrations/exercises that will take place in class. Problem-solving skills and a good knowledge of your own computer OS structure and function will definitely be useful. This course does not teach you system administration skills and you should know how to read help files and software guides, as well as retrieve information on-line. Should a student not have a portable computer, all code and demonstrations will be uploaded on this website and are available for practice on a desktop computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that most modern bioinformatic relies on Unix-based systems (macOS and Linux).

The critical comparison of the various methodologies of data acquisition, organization and processing will constitute the basis for the formulation of the student’s final judgment. Aspects that will be used to assess students’ learning level are their participation and interaction during the course and their ability to present and discuss scientific literature articles.\n\n\nPaper presentation\nEach student will, taking turns, be assigned a paper that he/she will present at the beginning of the next class. The presentation should consist of a PowerPoint (or .pdf or .slides) no longer than 20 minutes (~15 slides). At the end of each presentation the audience will have 10 minutes to ask questions or discuss the material presented. Each student in the audience has to prepare at least one question to ask the presenter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEven if you are not presenting the paper you still have to read it carefully to prepare your question and actively participate in the discussion!!\n\n\n\n\nProject\nTowards the end of class each student will be assigned a data set. To pass the course with full marks, the student should submit a report related to a project that he/sge would have developed starting from the assigned data set. Each student will have to use all the skills acquired during class, analyse the data set and submit the final project for evaluation. All the instructions on how to format the final report will be illustrated in class and added on this website.\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nParticipation\n15%\n\n\nPaper Presentation\n35%\n\n\nProject\n50%"

Sanger Sequecing produced anywhere between 50 and 1000 nucleotides at a time to be analysed on a regular computer.\nSince 1994 scientist have begun developing new technologies to parallelize DNA sequencing and produce high throughput data.\nAs these technologies improve, biologists need to harness the tools to design meaningful experiments to produce data and analyse them."
