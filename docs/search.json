Throughout the course students will be extensively exposed to various software and web-tools. All software used is freely available and relatively easy to install. It is necessary that each student has his/her own laptop in order to better follow the various demonstrations/exercise that will take place in class. Problem-solving skills and a good knowledge of the basic OS structure and functions will definitely be useful. This course does not teach you system administration skills and you should know how to read help files and software guides, as well as retrieve information on-line. Should a student not have a portable computer, all code and demonstrations will be up-loaded on this website and are available for practice on a desktop computer.\n\nNote that most modern bioinformatic relies on Unix-based systems (macOS and Linux). That being said, the material covered in class should work fine on Win systems as well!"

The critical comparison of the various methodologies of data acquisition, organization and processing will constitute the basis for the formulation of the student’s final judgment. Aspects that will be used to assess students’ learning level are their participation and interaction during the course and their ability to present and discuss scientific literature articles. To pass the course with full marks, each student must submit a report related to a project that the teachers will assign during the course."

As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret the biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using computational and statistical techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nBioinformaticians deal with a variety of different type of data! We are not bioinformaticians, we are evolutionary biologists and we will be dealing with the data of greatest interest to us: nucleotide sequence data."

Sanger Sequecing produced anywhere between 50 and 1000 nucleotides at a time to be analysed on a regular computer.\nSince 1994 scientist have begun developing new technologies to parallelize DNA sequencing and produce high throughput data.\nAs large dataset become available, biologists need to harness the tools to design meaningful experiments to produce data and analyse them."
