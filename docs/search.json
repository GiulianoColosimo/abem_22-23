Throughout the course students will be extensively exposed to various software and web-tools. It is necessary that each student has his/her own laptop in order to better follow the various demonstrations/exercise that will take place in class. Problem-solving skills and a good knowledge of the basic OS structure and functions will definitely be useful. Should a student not have a portable computer, all code and demonstrations will be up-loaded on this website and are available for practice on a desktop computer."

The critical comparison of the various methodologies of data acquisition, organization and processing will constitute the basis for the formulation of the student’s final judgment. Aspects that will be used to assess students’ learning level are their participation and interaction during the course and their ability to present and discuss scientific literature articles. To pass the course with full marks, each student must submit a report related to a project that the teachers will assign during the course."
