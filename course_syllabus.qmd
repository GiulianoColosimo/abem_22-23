## General information

This is an discretionary course for master level students enrolled in the "Biologia Evoluzionistica, Ecologia e Antropologia Applicata" degree at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. It is worth **3 CFU** for a total of 24 hours to be administered in person (or remotely, depending on the evolution of the pandemic) during the first semester of academic year 2022/2023.

## Course language

The course will be thought in Italian unless international students are present. In this latter case the course will be thought in English. All the material and the litterature used (including this website!) will be in English.

## Pre-requisites

This is an introductory course, so no prior knowledge of this topic is required. Throughout the course students will be extensively exposed to various software and web-tools. All software used is freely available and relatively easy to install. It is necessary that each student has his/her own laptop in order to better follow the various demonstrations/exercise that will take place in class. Problem-solving skills and a good knowledge of the basic OS structure and functions will definitely be useful. This course does not teach you system administration skills and you should know how to read help files and software guides, as well as retrieve information on-line. Should a student not have a portable computer, all code and demonstrations will be up-loaded on this website and are available for practice on a desktop computer.

> Note that most modern bioinformatic relies on Unix-based systems (macOS and Linux). That being said, the material covered in class should work fine on Win systems as well!

## Learning objectives

By the end of the course a student should be able to:

- Know the basics of different sequencing technologies;
- Work with common genetic and genomic data file (FASTA and FASTAQ);
- Learn how to use the R language to analyse large genomic data set;
- Query and obtain data from on-line nucleotide sequence databases;
- Perform basic ecological analyses from genomic data.


## Exam/Project

The assessment of the students' learning level will take place throughout the course, through the collegial discussion of primary literature on the main subject. The critical comparison of the various methodologies of data acquisition, organization and processing will constitute the basis for the formulation of the student's final judgment. Aspects that will be used to assess students' learning level are their participation and interaction during the course and their ability to present and discuss scientific literature articles. To pass the course with full marks, each student must submit a report related to a project that the teachers will assign during the course.
