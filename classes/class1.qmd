# 4. Bioinformatics

## What is Bioinformatics?

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics)

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. \[...\] bioinformatics combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics \[...\] using computational and statistical techniques.
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
Bioinformaticians deal with a variety of different type of data! **We are not bioinformaticians!!** We are evolutionary biologists!! We will focus on nucleotide sequence data.
:::

## Why Bioinformatics

> -   Back in the days, biologists could analyze their data on personal computers. [Sanger Sequecing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) produced anywhere between 50 and 1000 nucleotides at a time to be analysed on a regular computer.
> -   Since 1994 scientist have begun developing new technologies to parallelize DNA sequencing and produce high throughput data.
> -   As these technologies improve, biologists need to harness the tools to design meaningful experiments to produce data and analyse them.

# 5. Setting up your computer

## 

To visualize and analyse data and to produce reports on all the activities of this course we will be using **R** and **RStudio**. These are free cross-platform software.

-   Visit the **R** (https://cran.r-project.org) page and download the **R** version compatible to your OS. Install the software following the instructions.

-   Visit the **RStudio** (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) page and download the **RStudio** Desktop version compatible with your OS. Install the software following the instructions.

## 

**NOTE**: **RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) within which it should be easier to organize your **R** workflow. [Learning all the specifics of **R** and **RStudio** is beyond the scope of this course and it is a student's responsibility to learn the basics of these tools. That being said, you can always write me with your questions if something does not work on your computer and I will help troubleshooting potential issues.]{.underline}

## 

Once installed, open **RStudio**. If everything worked appropriately when you first open **RStudio**, you should see 4 different panes organized in the following way:

-   *top left*: the editor where you edit scripts, documents and can run code directly in the console;
-   *bottom left*: the **R** console, where the code is run. You can type code directly into the console OR you can send it to the console by running it from the editor;
-   *top right*: your environment/history panes. This is where you can see variables you've created and a full history of functions / commands you have run;
-   *bottom right*: by default contains several panes including: files/plots/packages/help/viewer. The files pane allows you to explore files on your computer like you would in windows explorer or finder on a mac. The plots tab is where you will see plots that you create.

## 

![R-Studio screenshot. You can change many of the aspects parameters (colors, font, panes etc.etc...).](../images/class1/rstudio.png){fig-alt="R-Studio screenshot" fig-align="center"}

## Packages

There are thousands of available libraries (aka, *packages*) that can be used to perform very specific analyses and produce publication-grade graphical output.
